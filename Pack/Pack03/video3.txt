Boyce-Codd Normal Form

Decomposition of a relational schema
	*Decomposition A relation in B JOIN C where A = B JOIN C
Relational desing by decomposition 
	*"Mega" ralations + properties of the data
	*System decomposes based on properties
	-"Good" decompositions only. reassembly poduces the original
	-Into "good" relations
Relation R with FDs(functional dependencies) is in BCNF if:
	For each A -> B, A is a key
	if not then is a bas desing.
Does BCNF guarantee a good decomposition?
	*Removes anomalies?
	*Can logically reconstruct original relation?
		Too few o too many tuples?
